A cross-platform mob-timer built on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)
for doing [Mob Programming](http://mobprogramming.org/). This is a fork from [pluralsight/mob-timer](https://github.com/pluralsight/mob-timer).

![Example Timer Image](timer-example.png)

Click the gear icon in the top right to configure the mob-timer.
Then click the large circle to start/stop the mob-timer,
or the smaller circle to skip to the next mobber.

# Running the mob-timer

You can either build the mob-timer from source or [download a pre-built version](https://github.com/mob-timer/mob-timer/releases).

## Build mob-timer

Run `npm install` and then one of the following commands for your respective operating system:
- Windows: `npm run build-win`
- Mac OS X: `npm run build-mac`
- Linux: `npm run build-linux` (You may need to install `libcanberra-gtk-module`)

Platform specific packages will be placed in the `dist` directory.
If you need a platform other than these, you will need to modify the build script in the `package.json` file.


# Development

Run `npm install` to get the dependencies, then `npm start` to run the timer.
Run `npm test` to run the unit tests once, or alternatively `npm run watch` to run them on changes.

# Reasons for forking

_This is a fork from [pluralsight/mob-timer](https://github.com/pluralsight/mob-timer), please have a look to see if that project is more suited to your needs!_ ðŸ™‚
 
There are a few main reasons for this fork existing:

- To build in CI and attach to release using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
- To stay up to date with dependencies using [Greenkeeper.io](https://greenkeeper.io/)
- To move to code style and tooling suited for project, not needing to take internal company best practices into account
- To have an independent organization where the mob-timer is the focus
